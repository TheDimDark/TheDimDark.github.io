                        I intend to collaborate with others to create unique, useful, and easy-to-use software and data solutions while hoping to challenge my creativity in making each project I work on better than the last. To do this, I intend to use my interpersonal skills and visual thought process in a well-organized and thorough manner.

                        This is my senior project, in which I worked on alongside a partner. I primarily covered the front-end programming and the database queries, but also handled the majority of written documentation. The site features many common forum elements such as being able to make, edit, and delete posts, linking to other posts, subscribing to threads. Users can log in and report malicious activity, and ranked users can handle reports and take action based on repeat offenses based off of the ability of their rank. Users can format and customize thier posts with the integrate BBCode and are notified of account changes by email with the use of PHPMailer.

                        This was a project I worked on over the span of two assignments for my Server-Side course in my senior year of college. It is a website in which the user can order from a series of different types of sushi that are pulled from a database, and their orders are stored and marked for delivery. The website automatically calculates your total cost and rings you up upon asking for your address, and even calculates an estimated delivery time based off the number of orders in line ahead of yours. A subpage exists where workers can view and change the progress of incoming orders. There is also a shareholderâ€™s page where various statistics from the orders are displayed.

                        This website was the term project for my Client-Side course, in which we were asked to create an E-Commerce website with a partner. My partner and I based our site off of the cartoon King of the Hill, and create a three-page company website where customers can learn about the company, view the products, and submit work-order forms in case they are experiencing any troubles with products. I did all of the CSS myself and handled all of the Javascript programming for the Home and Products page. I assisted in testing the Work Order Form as well.

                        My Client-Side course required use to build a word guessing game in order for us to demonstrate our ability to utilize Javascript. This webpage selects one word from a predetermined key of words, and scrambles it. The user gets three chances to guess the word, and is rewarded a number of points and starts based off of how quickly they guess the word. Each level increases the length of the scrambled word by one character in order to provide a form of scaling difficulty for the user. Positive and negative feedback is provided by sounds as well as visual graphics and text.
